# I would reccommend using -d since Mongo is quite verbose at start up (blah blah blah)

# Check out logs from each server

# Run this command to open bash
sudo docker exec -it c3_server_1 bash
sudo docker exec -it c3_server2_1 bash

# Inside the bash command of c3_server2_1
ping c3_server_1 #This should show the server2 can reach server

# When you're all done, run this command to decompose container and remove all associated volumes
