# The Interview Challenge
## Challenge 1
Assume a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which nodes can have multiple parents and there is a single unique root node. The minimum number of edges connecting any node n with the DAG's root node r is considered the depth d ( n ) of node n . Because a node can have many parents, there might be several routes, of varying number of edges, from the node to the root r . Provide a test (see Test Driven Development ) that executes your solution and verifies, it works as expected. Then write the function that returns the depth of a node given the DAG and test it with your test. Assume the DAG, i.e. the input to your function, to be represented as an adjacency matrix . Another input argument is the root node, i.e. consider the root node to be known so that your algorithm does not need to find it. Use any programming language you like to solve this challenge. You will receive extra points if you implement the solution in either Brainfuck or Assembler , but because you will be considered not totally sane we will not invite you to dinner.

## Challenge 2
two routes "/foo" and "/bar". "foo" should write the response "Hello" and "bar" should write the String "World" to the response in JSON format, serializing the objects { response: “Hello” } or { response: “World” } respectively. Make sure the response is exactly as defined here. The important point in this exercise is to parametrize the server at startup depending on two environment variables "PORT" and "BASE_URL". "PORT" indicates on which port the express server will listen, and "BASE_URL" defines which will be the base path inserted before the two above routes "foo" and "bar".

## Challenge 3
Use Docker and docker-compose to set up three containers:
● Database 
● Server A 
● Server B 
The database container shall host a relational database, e.g. MySQL , Postgres , SQLite, etc., and reside inside the same network as Server A . Have a default database installed and running on the database server. Server B shall have no access to the database, but be able to connect to Server A . On startup Server A executes a simple shell-script that checks whether it can connect to the database and logs that to standard-out. Server B executes a similar script on startup and checks, e.g. using ping or nc, whether Server A is available, and logs the result to its standard-out. Consider using simple Debian or Alpine Linux images for A and B , and a standard relational database docker image for the database server. Write a simple Shell-Script that starts the network as described and prints out the respective outputs of the startup scripts.
